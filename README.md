# MLRegressionFromScratch
Try to collect and revise typical Machine learning regression models from scratch to increase the adjustability of the different parameters for non-computer scientists' usages.In the following list (Updating) you see the discussed algorithms in this repo:
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. Lasso Regression
5. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
6. Decision Tree Regression
7. Random Forest Regression
8. Gradient Boosting Regression
9. Neural Network Regression

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the simplest regression models that has various applications in different areas of scinece and engineering. this regression produce an output by an weighted average of the inputs. inputs are typically the effective parameters and the output represents the target variable in the experiment.This algorithm assume a linear behavoiur in the target variable which is as simple as a proportionality!

### Single variable Linear Regression
In the Single variable linear regression, the output is generated by the sum of a constant value (call it 'intercept') and the product of a coefficient (call it 'slope') and the single input variable. The following equation shows the discussed relationship:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$

### Multi variable Linear Regression
Similar to the single variable type, the output comes from a simple sum of an intercept and a weighted average of the selected input variables. the following expression shows the mentioned mathematical relationship:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n$$
