# MLRegressionFromScratch
Try to collect and revise typical Machine learning regression models from scratch to increase the adjustability of the different parameters for non-computer scientists' usages.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the simplest regression models that has various applications in different areas of scinece and engineering. this regression produce an output by an weighted average of the inputs. inputs are typically the effective parameters and the output tepresents the target variable in the experiment.

### Single variable Linear Regression
In the Single variable linear regression, the output is generated by the sum of a constant value (call it 'intercept') and the product of a coefficient (call it 'slope') and the single input variable. The following equation shows the discussed relationship:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$
